Project created for practicing Next + TypeScript

- Based on The Meal Database: https://www.themealdb.com/
- The project will allow the users to search for meals with filters and get details about it
- There will be a default page for each meal, and the data will change depending on the route
- It will be my first time using Framer Motion

[Update]
- At some point of the project,I decided to refactor it because of undefined types and bad structuring
- Now, I'm trying to be cleaner and give more attention to performance
