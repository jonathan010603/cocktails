Project created for practicing Next + TypeScript

- Based on Cocktail Database: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/
- The project will allow the users to search for a drink with filters and get details about it
- There will be a default page for each drink, and the data will change depending on the route
- It will be my first time using Framer Motion
